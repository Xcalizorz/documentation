== Introduction

> Project Syn is a pre-integrated set of tools to provision, update, backup, observe and react/alert production applications on Kubernetes and in the cloud. It supports DevOps through full self-service and automation using containers, Kubernetes and GitOps.

All code lives on GitHub under https://github.com/projectsyn.

=== What's in for: Dev

The tooling provided by Project Syn enables the user of the platform to consume all the available services in self-service. By fully automating the day-2 operations (see below), all consumed services are automatically "managed." There is no need to use different configuration management tooling, it's all defined at the same place: Kubernetes objects in a Git repository, delivered and enforced by GitOps.

* Automated service deployment with https://crossplane.io/[Crossplane].
* Backup of data with https://k8up.io[K8up] and https://restic.readthedocs.io[Restic].
* GitOps with https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[Argo CD].
* Secrets management with https://www.vaultproject.io/[Vault].
* Monitoring and alerting with Prometheus, Alertmanager and Signalilo.

=== What's in for: Ops

With Project Syn it gets easy to manage a fleet of Kubernetes clusters. Delivering applications and configuration to all managed Kubernetes clusters and providing an inventory of all the available clusters and their content is part of Project Syn.

* Configuration management for system components with xref:commodore::index.adoc[Commodore], https://kapitan.dev/[Kapitan] and https://jsonnet.org/[Jsonnet] by leveraging a hierarchical configuration value store.
* Central cluster registry and inventory including GitOps Git repository management provided by https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-api[Lieutenant API], https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-operator[Lieutenant Operator] and xref:steward::index.adoc[Steward].
* Automated component maintenance with https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate[Renovate] which helps to keep all the applications up-to-date.

=== High-Level Architecture
