[NOTE]
.Summary
====
This SDD documents the design of the inventory and management API service which holds all information about Syn managed Kubernetes clusters.
====

== Motivation

A central inventory helps to keep track of all Syn managed Kubernetes clusters, their content and it is the central hub for all operational needs. It provides inventory data to query for all aspects about these clusters. All clusters must be registered in Lieutenant so that they can get recognized by the various components of Syn. It presents itself as a REST API, providing all the needed functionality. This API gets used by frontends like the VSHN Portal, by CLI clients or by other means of automation.

=== Goals

The API provides several key features for the Syn platform. It's architected around many helper services and orchestrates them to do their job well.

* Be the central hub of Syn managed services and clusters including tenant information, fully ready for multitenancy operations
* Provide insights to all running services and clusters
* Be the key part of config management by providing management functionality for GitOps Git repositories

=== Non-Goals

* Kubernetes cluster provisioning - That's up to external tools like Rancher and/or Crossplane

=== API Personas

== Design Proposal

image::lieutenant.png[]

Lieutenant is an OpenAPI 3.0 REST API written in Go. It makes use of
specialized Kubernetes Operators running on Kubernetes, implementing the
core functionality and reconciliation processes. The Lieutenant API
application runs in Kubernetes on works directly with the Kubernetes
API, managing the objects of the Operators.

=== REST API

Tenant Management::

* Management of tenants for assigning clusters and managing access rights.
CRUD functionality.
* For VSHN: The idea is to sync this data from the portal. A customer can be Syn enabled which then automatically syncs the information to Lieutenant and makes it available in the API.
* Data storage location: `Tenant` CRD

Cluster Registry::

* Registry of all Syn managed Kubernetes cluster with the following
features:
** Create (register) cluster
** Read (list) all clusters with filtering possibilities
** Update (edit) cluster
** Delete cluster
* The following information is stored:
** Automatically generated cluster ID (string with 6 lowercase chars and
numbers) - not editable
** Cluster display name
** Initial registration key for Steward
*** Lifetime
*** Validity
** Kubernetes API endpoint
** Reference to Kubernetes credentials in Vault
* Data storage location: `Cluster` CRD

Facts Inventory::

* Inventory of facts about the clusters and services with a query interface.
* The key of the facts is the cluster ID.
* There are two type of facts:
** _Static facts_: Manually configured meta information about a cluster,
stored in cluster Object: Tenant, SLA, Contact information, Cloud information, Kubernetes distribution
** _Dynamic facts_: Facts collected by an in-cluster agent and regularly
sent to Lieutenant, stored in Timeseries DB: Kubernetes version, Deployed managed services and their version, Node details (OS, CPU, RAM, labels) and number of nodes, important objects, Syn predefined annotations on objects, per object contact information and responsibilities via annotations, _Ingress_ objects `spec.rules[].host` (helps to find which cluster
hosts which URL).
* Facts are not actively collected by polling, they are pushed to the API
by Steward.
* All dynamic facts are versioned (and update generates a new version)
which allows historical information when has what changed. Facts have
timestamps, so that a freshness indicator is possible.
* Data storage location: _InfluxDB_

Component state::

* Live state of the managed services
* Querying Argo CD, running on the cluster
* Data storage location: _Argo CD_

Steward Configuration::

* Deployment and configuration delivery for Steward bootstrapping
* The API provides the Steward deployment JSON for the initial cluster
synfection.
* The following data is delivered to Steward:
** URL to cluster catalog git repository
** SSH host key of git repository

Vault Integration::

* Vault bootstrapping for cluster
* The API configures Vault for the cluster:
** Create access credentials
** Configure authorization
** Steward authentication token handling
*** Bootstrap token can only be used once and for a limited time. After
bootstrapping the token will be generated by Vault and used by Steward
from now on.

Maintenance Utilities::

* Helper functions to facilitate proper maintenance
* Integration with Renovate, f.e. list all open Renovate Merge Request
on different Git repository instances, including the possibility to
merge them.
* Integration with to-be-invented host maintenance agent?
* Data storage location: Git Merge/Pull requests

==== REST OpenAPI Spec

All objects are stored in the same Kubernetes namespace as the API and
the Operator is running.

The OpenAPI specification is stored in Git: https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-api/blob/master/openapi.yaml[openapi.yaml].

==== API Authentication

_*tbd*_

oauth2 and/or openid connect

==== API Authorization

_*tbd*_

Open Policy Agent with Go library

* Directly in Go:

* Or

=== Operator and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===

a|
CRD

a|
Description

|_Tenant_ |When a tenant is created, a _GitRepo_ object
is created to create the *tenant configuration repository*.

|_GitRepo_ a|
Git repository management (CRUD repos on GitLab, GitHub and Gitea).
Lieutenant manages the CR objects and queries the status fields to get
the status.

The Operator manages the following objects:

_GitRepo_

* Create Git repository +
** By default on http://git.vshn.net/[git.vshn.net] GitLab
** Supported are GitLab, GitHub and Gitea APIs
** SSH key delivered by Steward is configured as deploy key
* Delete Git repository
* Update Git repository when configuration changes
** Only SSH deploy key change supported

|_Cluster_ a|
When a _Cluster_ object is created:

* a _GitRepo_ object is created to create the *cluster catalog
configuration repository*.
* a _Proxy_ object is created to provision an Inlets endpoint for the
cluster

When a _Cluster_ object is deleted:

* All created objects are deleted by ownerReference mechanisms

|_Proxy_ a|
Manages the deployment and configuration of an Inlets server per Syn
Kubernetes cluster.

==== Operator Common

The first iteration is a single Operator consisting of several
controllers, sharing CR Go structs as the objects depend on each other.
A later iteration could split these controllers into their own Operator
if it makes sense then. The Operator will be implemented using the
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/[operator-sdk] in Go.

still `Cluster` objects available referencing the Tenant object to be
deleted
