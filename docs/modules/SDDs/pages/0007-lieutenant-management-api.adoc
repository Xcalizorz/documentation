[NOTE]
.Summary
====
This SDD documents the design of the inventory and management API service which holds all information about Syn managed Kubernetes clusters.
====

== Motivation

A central inventory helps to keep track of all Syn managed Kubernetes clusters, their content and it's the central hub for all operational needs. It provides inventory data to query for all aspects about these clusters. All clusters must be registered in Lieutenant so that they can get recognized by the various components of Syn. It presents itself as a REST API, providing all the needed functionality. This API gets used by frontends like the VSHN Portal, by CLI clients or by other means of automation.

=== Goals

The API provides several key features for the Syn platform. It's architected around many helper services and orchestrates them to do their job well.

* Be the central hub of Syn managed services and clusters including tenant information, fully ready for multitenancy operations
* Provide insights to all running services and clusters
* Be the key part of config management by providing management functionality for GitOps Git repositories

=== Non-Goals

* Kubernetes cluster provisioning - That's up to external tools like Rancher or Crossplane

== Design Proposal

image::lieutenant.png[]

LieutenantÂ is an OpenAPI 3.0 REST API written in Go. It makes use of
specialized Kubernetes Operators running on Kubernetes, implementing the
core functionality and reconciliation processes. The Lieutenant API
application runs in Kubernetes on works directly with the Kubernetes
API, managing the objects of the Operators.

=== REST API

Tenant Management::

* Management of tenants for assigning clusters and managing access rights.
CRUD functionality.
* For VSHN: The idea is to sync this data from the portal. A customer can be Syn enabled which then automatically syncs the information to Lieutenant and makes it available in the API.
* Data storage location: `Tenant` CRD

Cluster Registry::

* Registry of all Syn managed Kubernetes clusters with the following features:
** Create (register) cluster
** Read (list) all clusters with filtering capabilities
** Update (edit) cluster
** Delete cluster
* The following information is stored:
** Automatically generated cluster ID (string with 6 lowercase chars and numbers) - not editable
** Cluster display name
** Initial registration key for Steward
*** Lifetime
*** Validity
** Kubernetes API endpoint
** Reference to Kubernetes credentials in Vault
* Data storage location: `Cluster` CRD

Facts Inventory::

* Inventory of facts about the clusters and services with a query interface.
* The key of the facts is the cluster ID.
* There are two type of facts:
** _Static facts_: Manually configured meta information about a cluster,
stored in cluster Object: Tenant, SLA, Contact information, Cloud information, Kubernetes distribution
** _Dynamic facts_: Facts collected by an in-cluster agent and regularly
sent to Lieutenant, stored in Timeseries DB: Kubernetes version, Deployed managed services and their version, Node details (OS, CPU, RAM, labels) and number of nodes, important objects, Syn predefined annotations on objects, per object contact information and responsibilities via annotations, _Ingress_ objects `spec.rules[].host` (helps to find which cluster
hosts which URL).
* Facts aren't actively collected by polling, they're pushed to the API
by Steward.
* All dynamic facts are versioned (and update generates a new version)
which allows historical information when has what changed. Facts have
timestamps, so that a freshness indicator is possible.
* Data storage location: _InfluxDB_

Component state::

* Live state of the managed services
* Querying Argo CD, running on the cluster
* Data storage location: _Argo CD_

Steward Configuration::

* Deployment and configuration delivery for Steward bootstrapping
* The API provides the Steward deployment JSON for the initial cluster
synfection.
* The following data is delivered to Steward:
** URL to cluster catalog git repository
** SSH host key of git repository

Vault Integration::

* Vault bootstrapping for cluster
* The API configures Vault for the cluster:
** Create access credentials
** Configure authorization
** Steward authentication token handling
*** Bootstrap token can only be used once and for a limited time

Maintenance Utilities::

* Helper functions to facilitate proper maintenance
* Integration with Renovate, f.e. list all open Renovate Merge Request
on different Git repository instances, including the possibility to
merge them.
* Integration with to-be-invented host maintenance agent?
* Data storage location: Git Merge/Pull requests

==== REST OpenAPI Spec

All objects are stored in the same Kubernetes namespace as the API and
the Operator is running.

The OpenAPI specification is stored in Git: https://github.com/projectsyn/lieutenant-api/blob/master/openapi.yaml[openapi.yaml].

==== API Authentication

===== Bearer Token

Authentication to the API is handled via https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens[Kubernetes service account tokens]. Except for the `/docs`, `/healthz` and `/install/steward.json` endpoints, every request must contain a bearer token. The HTTP header `Authorization` must be set to `Bearer <token>` with `<token>` beign a valid https://jwt.io/[JWT token]. This JWT token will then be used by the API to authenticate against the Kubernetes cluster.

===== Bootstrap Token

The `/install/steward.json` endpoint must provide a query parameter `token` which contains the bootstrap token of a cluster. Such a token can only be used once and has a short (for example ~30 minutes) expiry time. The API uses it's own service account to authenticate to Kubernetes and search the clusters for the provided bootstrap token. Once a cluster is found and the bootstrap token is still valid, the installation manifests will be returned and the token marked invalid.

===== API Token

The API needs a service account to authenticate to Kubernetes. This service account should have the minimum required rights to search for clusters, mark bootstrap tokens as invalid and read a cluster's service account token.

==== API Authorization

With the exception of the `/install/steward.json` endpoint, authorization of all API requests is fully delegated to the Kubernetes cluster.

===== Kubernetes RBAC

Kubernets RBAC rules will be used to restrict the various service accounts to their required scope.

===== Open Policy Agent

The https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent] (OPA) will be used to further restrict access of the service accounts to the cluster. More advanced features like a tenant accessing all his clusters can be implemented with the OPA which can not be represented by RBAC alone.

===== Cluster Bootstrap

The `/install/steward.json` endpoint serves as an entrypoint to bootstrap (adopt) a new cluster. It delivers the manifests required to bootstrap the SYN system on a cluster. Authorization is done via a <<Bootstrap Token>> which identifies the cluster to bootstrap. The API searches the cluster and checks the validity of the token: if the token has expired or was already used (attribute `valid=false`).

===== Different Entities

Cluster::

A service account per cluster is created with an RBAC role restricting it's access to the cluster it belongs to (using https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-resources[resourceNames]).

Tenant::

=== Operator and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===

a|
CRD

a|
Description

|_Tenant_ |When a tenant is created, a _GitRepo_ object
is created to create the *tenant configuration repository*.

|_GitRepo_ a|
Git repository management (CRUD repos on GitLab, GitHub and Gitea).
Lieutenant manages the CR objects and queries the status fields to get
the status.

The Operator manages the following objects:

_GitRepo_

* Create Git repository +
** By default on http://git.vshn.net/[git.vshn.net] GitLab
** Supported are GitLab, GitHub and Gitea APIs
** SSH key delivered by Steward is configured as deploy key
* Delete Git repository
* Update Git repository when configuration changes
** Only SSH deploy key change supported

|_Cluster_ a|
When a _Cluster_ object is created:

* a _GitRepo_ object is created to create the *cluster catalog
configuration repository*.
* a _Proxy_ object is created to provision an Inlets endpoint for the
cluster

When a _Cluster_ object is deleted:

* All created objects are deleted by ownerReference mechanisms

|_Proxy_ a|
Manages the deployment and configuration of an Inlets server per Syn
Kubernetes cluster.

==== Operator Common

The first iteration is a single Operator consisting of several
controllers, sharing CR Go structs as the objects depend on each other.
A later iteration could split these controllers into their own Operator
if it makes sense then. The Operator will be implemented using the
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/[operator-sdk] in Go.
