[NOTE]
.Summary
====
This describes how we want to integrate https://github.com/openshift/hive[OpenShift Hive] into Syn to automatically provision OpenShift clusters on supported cloud providers.
====

== Motivation

The OpenShift Hive operator provides fully automated provisioning of new OpenShift clusters using the https://github.com/openshift/installer[OpenShift installer].
We want to integrate this into the Syn project in order to provision OpenShift clusters.
Currently the following cloud providers are supported by Hive:
* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud Platform

=== Goals

* Define how Hive can be integrated into Syn
* Define the process of creating and provisioning a new OpenShift cluster


=== Non-Goals

* Support anything else than what Hive provides
* Scale a cluster via Hive


== Design Proposal

=== Hive Overview

Hive is an operator and works on the following CRDs:

* `ClusterImageSet` to define the OpenShift version
* `ClusterDeployment` to define a cluster
* `MachinePool` to define the sizing/scaling of a cluster

In addition to these CRDs the operator needs various secrets for the following information:

* Image pull secret for the OpenShift images
* Credentials for the cloud provider
* SSH keypair to access machines of the provisioned cluster
* An `install-config.yaml` to configure the OpenShift installer

Most of the heavy lifting Hive does is implemented by the OpenShift installer which is also why the `install-config.yaml` file is required.
This file is the same format as described in the installer https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/customization.md#platform-customization[docs].
It needs to be provided in a secret and is only changed by the operator to set the `pullSecret` property with the referenced image pull secret.


=== Implementation Details

A controller is implemented which creates the necessary objects to provide Hive with the necessary information to provision an OpenShift cluster.
Based on certain conditions the controller creates a set of objects (secrets and Hive CRs).
For example if a cluster object has the annotation `syn.tools/cluster-provisioner=hive` set, an OpenShift cluster should be provisioned via Hive.


==== Provisioning Information

In order for this controller to be able to create the necessary objects, it needs to receive certain information.
All confidential information (like cloud provider credentials or image pull secrets) should be stored in Kubernetes secrets and referenced.
In a first PoC phase, all information that's not yet present in a cluster's facts must be provided in annotations on the cluster object:

* `hive.syn.tools/gcp-project` GCP project name
* `hive.syn.tools/base-domain` Base domain
* `hive.syn.tools/credentials-secret` Name of the secret containing the cloud credentials

The reason for using annotations being that we don't have to change the cluster CRD for the PoC.
In a second step, once this design is validated and accepted, the information can be added as a typed struct to the cluster CRD.


==== Cluster Scaling

Scaling of a cluster shouldn't be done via Hive.
For provisioning we use a default setup of three master and three worker nodes.
Once a cluster is provisioned, scaling will be implemented via other means for example in a Commodore component.


=== Risks and Mitigations

With this design we're relatively tightly coupled to the Hive operator as in the created CRs (API) are defined by it.
If Hive changes it's API we've to implement these changes as well.
As long as Hive follows the concept of a Kubernetes operator (acting on CRDs), the basic idea of this design should always apply though.


== Alternatives

An alternative approach would be to leave the creation of the Hive CRs out of Syn and implement it in another component.
This could be an option if project Syn shouldn't provide specific provisioning options for Kubernetes distributions.
The basic idea of this design would still apply though and it could be implemented separate from the Syn project.
